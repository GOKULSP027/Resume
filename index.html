            >Design of Modified Full Adder-Based Low Power Array
            Multiplier:</strong>
          <br>
          This project focuses on optimizing the
          power efficiency of digital multiplication circuits. By modifying the standard full-adder design, 
          the project reduces power consumption in array multipliers, which are typically power-hungry due to
          their bit-level operations. The design integrates a low-power full-adder into an array multiplier
          to enhance performance while minimizing energy usage. This solution is particularly beneficial for
          applications in embedded systems, mobile devices, and other battery-operated devices, where efficient
          power management is crucial without compromising functionality. <br><br>

          <strong>Library Management System:</strong> <br>
          The Library Management System using Core Java manages books, users, and transactions through basic Java concepts such as classes, objects, arrays, and collections. It includes modules for adding, searching, and updating books, registering users, and tracking book issuance and returns. The system uses simple file handling or in-memory data structures to store and retrieve information, offering a straightforward, lightweight solution for library management.

          <strong>Development of a Banking Application Using Java and MySQL :</strong> <br>
          The <b>Banking Application</b> using <b>Java</b> and <b>MySQL</b> efficiently manages user accounts, transactions, and balances. It consists of three main modules: <b>Accounts</b>, <b>User</b>, and <b>Account Management</b>, handling tasks like account creation, user authentication, and fund transfers. The MySQL database stores user and transaction data. The modular design ensures scalability, maintainability, and the potential for future features, offering a secure and seamless banking experience for users.

          <strong>Solar Panel Tracking System:</strong><br>
          The Solar Panel Tracking System uses a microcontroller and LDR sensors to track the position of the sun. The system adjusts the angle of the solar panel to align with the sun's rays, optimizing power output. By continuously detecting light intensity, the system maximizes energy efficiency, improving the overall performance and effectiveness of solar power generation.
